Firstly	O

extra	B-Premise

By	B-Premise

training	B-Premise
time	I-Premise
can	I-Premise

Clearly	O
,	O
in	B-Premise
company	I-Premise
we	I-Premise
always	I-Premise
have	I-Premise
to	I-Premise
deal	I-Premise
with	I-Premise
so	I-Premise
many	I-Premise
stressful	I-Premise
situations	I-Premise
such	I-Premise
as	I-Premise
negotiating	I-Premise

difficult	I-Premise
customer	I-Premise

we	B-Claim

them	I-Premise
for	I-Premise
future	I-Premise

so	O
I	O

the	B-Claim
